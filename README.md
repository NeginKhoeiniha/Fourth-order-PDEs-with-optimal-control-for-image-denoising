# Fourth-order-PDEs-with-optimal-control-for-image-denoising

In this project, a nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equation is developed for image denoising with unknown coefficients which will be determined via the optimal control problem.

The proposed PDE is constructed with a set of image differential invarients up to fourth order and is considered as the constrants of the optimal control problem in which, the coefficients are the controls to be found.
